Time Series Analysis of Microbial Data

This is a self initiated project without any particular outcome. I was really curious to understand Time Series
in the context of how our microbes change in our gut over time.

I tried building a Bayesian Model using Kevin Murphy (a Google Scientist). I also used a Lomb Scargle analysis to understand the frequency of the microbes changing with time. 

The data used is a fecal sample over time, found in Data folder.
